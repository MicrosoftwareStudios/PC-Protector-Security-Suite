ATTENTION!!! THIS ONLY WORKS ON LINUX!!!!!!
Extract the ZIP and run install.sh. Agree to the EULA and let it install. Please note, this requires an internet connection because the installer downloads the files from the MSW servers.

## NOTICE:
As we move forward and begin consolidating software and its development platforms, we are moving away from Linux. This update is the latest and will soon be replaced by a full GUI version for Windows that incorporates the good features from this program, while adding better scanners and an advanced heuristics scanner. In addition, the installer will cease to function on July 31, 2025, as the necessary files will be taken down from the server.

As of 7/23/25, the files from the server have been added to this repository ahead of its removal from the server. In addition, the download link on the website was removed to make way for the Windows version. Anyone who wishes to use the files for any purpose may do so.
